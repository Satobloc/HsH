"""Detect standalone JSON conversation exports regardless of plaintext filename.

The Conversation Viewer and date indexer must agree on whether a source is
structured JSON. This is a cheap, bounded *content sniff*, not a JSON parser
or an invitation to treat arbitrary prose containing braces as a conversation.

Any regular, non-symlinked file may qualify based on its contents, regardless
of extension. The probe reads at most 8192 bytes. Actual JSON decoding and
ChatGPT-conversation structure remain separate gates.
Original bytes, paths and file extensions are never rewritten here.
